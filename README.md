# Apache Pinot - Pulsar Ingestion Plugin

This plugin is our own implementation of a pulsar ingestion plugin for Pinot. It was developed against Pinot 0.7 initially so it's not up to date with the latest pinot version however we run it against pinot 0.12 without issue.

You might want to use the official pulsar plugin: https://github.com/apache/pinot/tree/master/pinot-plugins/pinot-stream-ingestion/pinot-pulsar
